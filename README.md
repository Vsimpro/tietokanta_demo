# Database_demo,
Demo site for our database course.
## To run;
  - Add in creds to your "pre-configured" mariaDB,
  -  `python3 demo.py` opens a flask application to your localhost:55006

### Noteworthy, 
doesn't work properly if you don't use our exact database due to the specifity of the queries. 
Might add the data + commands for documentation purposes later.
